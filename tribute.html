                        <p class="biography-discription mt-3"> Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist
                            who made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe.
                            He was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, and grew up in St.
                            Albans, a town north of London.Hawking's early work focused on black
                            holes and the nature of the universe. In 1974, he proposed the theory
                            that black holes emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This
                            theory challenged the widely held belief that nothing can escape a black hole's gravitational pull. Hawking's work on black holes and cosmology made him one of the most famous scientists in the world.
                            Hawking was also a bestselling author, with several popular science books
                            to his name, including "A Brief History of Time," which has sold millions of
                            copies worldwide. In addition to his scientific work, Hawking was an advocate
                            for people with disabilities and a vocal supporter of various social and political causes.
